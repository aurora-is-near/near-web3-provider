# *NOTE: THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE*

# near-web3-provider

NEAR Protocol Web3 provider.
Use it to connect your Ethereum frontend or Truffle to NEAR Protocol.

## Requirements

**Node > 11.0**

## Install

```bash
$ npm install near-web3-provider
```

## Running Tests

Tests require [running a local `nearcore`](https://docs.nearprotocol.com/docs/local-setup/local-dev-testnet).

> Note: `nearcore` should be on `stable` branch.

### Setup and Run NEARCore

Install Rustup:
```
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Add wasm target to your toolchain:
```
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Install and run NEARCore using Docker:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore
$ cd nearcore
$ ./scripts/start_unittest.py --local
```

Run tests
```
$ npm run test
```

Tests currently take ~50 seconds to run.

## Developing

The web3 Provider also needs to be tested against the `near-evm` contract.

Follow the testing instructions on the [near-evm repo](https://github.com/near/near-evm#testing).

If you're developing against an in-flux contract, make sure to build the wasm code from `near-evm` and update the wasm code for the provider: `/artifacts/near_evm.wasm`.

## General Usage

You can use this provider wherever a Web3 provider is needed.

```javascript
const { NearProvider, nearlib, nearWeb3Extensions } = require('near-web3-provider');

const nearNetworkId = '<local, default, test, etc>'; // default is 'default'
const accountId = '<account id to use for tx>';
const keyStore = new nearlib.keyStores.<one of keyStores>;

const web = new Web3();
web.extend(nearWeb3Extensions(web)) // extend web3 to include customized near methods
web.setProvider(new NearProvider("<url to NEAR RPC>", keyStore, accountId, nearNetworkId));
web.eth.net.isListening();
```

## Using in Truffle

Add to your `truffle-config.js`:

```javascript
// Import NearProvider and nearlib
const { NearProvider, nearlib } = require('near-web3-provider');

// Specify which NEAR network to use
const nearNetworkId = '<local, default, test, etc>';

// If developing against a local node, use http://localhost:3030
const url = 'https://rpc.nearprotocol.com';

// Specify where to store keys
const keyDir = 'neardev';

// Use standard near-shell structure for storing keys. See note below for other options.
const keyStore = new nearlib.keyStores.UnencryptedFileSystemKeyStore(keyDir);

// Account ID
const accountId = 'test.account';

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    near: {
        network_id: "99",
        skipDryRun: true,
        provider: function() {
            return new NearProvider(url, keyStore, accountId, nearNetworkId)
        },
    }
  }
}
```
See [key store documentation](https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearlib/blob/master/lib/key_stores/index.d.ts) for other options.

## Differences from Ethereum providers

NEAR Protocol is a sharded, proof-of-stake blockchain. Keeping that in mind, some Ethereum concepts are naturally not shared with NEAR; for example, there is no concept of uncle blocks, pending blocks, or block difficulty.

As a sharded blockchain, the structure of NEAR blocks is also different. In Ethereum, blocks have transactions. In NEAR, blocks have chunks, and chunks have transactions.

`near-web3-provider` has been adapted to follow the [Ethereum JSON RPC API](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/json-rpc) and its [`web3` equivalents](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.4/web3-eth.html#) as closely as possible. Where there are no equivalents, empty values have been passed through. Other return values have been adapted to account for the difference in block structure (for example, the root of the transaction trie comes from a chunk rather than a block).

Mining, hashrates, `ssh,` and `db` methods are not supported.

### Limitations and Differences

* [Methods](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/json-rpc#the-default-block-parameter) that have an extra default block parameter will function as `latest`, regardless of the actual argument. This is a Near RPC limitation.

* `eth_call` does not support `from` or `value` arguments. This is a Near RPC limitation.

* `eth_estimateGas` will always return `0x0`. Near RPC does not seem to support
  gas estimation for calls.

* Some fields in Ethereum data structures do not have a direct correspondance to Near data structures, therefore these fields are unimplemented or unreliable. Always consult implementation in near_to_eth_objects.js. Examples include:
  * The tx receipts `status` field is always `0x1`, regardless of the success of the transaction.
  * `transactionIndex` is constant, and not reliable.

* Some calls, like `eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex` have no sensible correspondance to Near block structure.

* Near doesn't keep track of nonces for contracts which is a required feature for the evm. Therefore both an evm nonce and near nonce exist for each account. `eth_getTransactionCount` will return a reference to the evm nonce. All other nonce fields in the web3-near-provider reference the near nonce.
    * evm nonce: nonce used for address calculation in the next EVM contract deployment from this EVM account
    * near nonce: number of all near transactions (including evm transactions) executed by account

## API Overview

Unless specified, NearProvider returns the values specified in the web3 documentation for each method.

If a method has no direct translation, an `Unsupported method` error is returned.

### Hash Conversions and Equivalents

Near uses `base58` while Ethereum uses `Keccak`. This necessitates the need to convert between the two. With the exception of transaction hashes, Near hashes are converted to Ethereum-compatible hashes when using `web3`.

### Important Format Changes

* `blockHash` - a block hash is the hash equivalent of a Near block hash
  * denoted in `hex` within the context of the near-web3-provider
  * denoted in `base58` within the context of the rest of the near protocol

* `transactionHash` - a transaction hash is the combination of a Near transaction hash (in `base58`) concatenanted with the accountId of the transaction's sender, and separated by `:`
  * `<base58TxHash>:<senderAccountId>` within the context of the near-web3-provider
  * `<senderAccountId>:<base58TxHash>` within the context of the rest of the near protocol

* `gas` - Gas is denominated in yoctoNEAR

* `value` - Transaction values/amounts are denominated in yoctoNEAR

* `to`, `from`, `address` - Addresses are the EVM hash of a Near AccountId

### web3.eth.getBlockTransactionCount

```
web3.eth.getBlockTransactionCount(blockHashOrBlockNumber)
```

Returns the number of transactions in a given block.

#### Parameters
1. `{String|Number|BN|BigNumber}` - The block number or block hash. Or the string `'genesis'`, `'latest'`, `'earliest'`, or `'pending'`

#### Returns
`Promise` returns `Number` - The number of transactions in the given block.

### Differences | Limitations
* Blocks have chunks and chunks have transactions; all the transactions are collected from a block's chunks and counted. Conceptually this is the same thing, but note that transactions do not actually reside in blocks.

---

### web3.eth.getTransaction

```
web3.eth.getTransaction(transactionHash)
```

Returns a transaction matching the given transaction hash.

#### Parameters
1. `String` `transactionHash` - the transaction hash

#### Returns

`Promise` returns `Object` - A transaction object

* `hash` - Hash of the transaction `<nearTxHash>:<accountId>` (transaction's sender's accountId)
* `nonce` - The total number of near transactions made by the sender prior to this one
* `blockHash` - hash equivalent of the block where this transaction was in (represented in hex instead of near's base58 format)
* `blockNumber` - Block number where this transaction was in
* `transactionIndex` - integer of the transactions index position in the block
* `from` - EVM Address of the sender
* `to` - EVM address of the receiver
* `value` - Value transfered in yoctoNEAR
* `gasPrice` - Gas price set by the block in yoctoNEAR
* `gas` - Gas consumed by the sender in yoctoNEAR
* `input` - tx data, encoded contract call or deployed bytecode

#### Differences | Limitations

* Due to the Near protocol, getting a transaction's status requires knowing both the transaction hash _and_ the Near AccountId of the transaction's signer. To allow for this, transaction hashes in NearProvider are the base58 transaction hashes concatenated with the `signer_id` of the transaction, and separated with a `:`.

  Example:
    ```
    // A Near transaction hash (base58)
    const nearTxHash = 'ByGDjvYxVZDxv69c86tFCFDRnJqK4zvj9uz4QVR4bH4P';

    // A Near AccountId. In particular, the AccountId of the transaction's signer
    const signerId = 'test.near'

    // Concatenate and separate with ':'
    const txHash = `${nearTxHash}:${signerId};

    console.log(txHash);

    // ByGDjvYxVZDxv69c86tFCFDRnJqK4zvj9uz4QVR4bH4P:test.near
    ```
* See [Important Format Changes](###Important%20Format%20Changes) for additional information.

## To Do
- [ ] Update hardcoded `transactionIndex`
- [x] Make sure all errors are handled
- [ ] Expose `utils.nearAccountToEvmAddress`, otherwise users will not be able to pass through the EVM Address equivalent
- [ ] Expose conversion utils like `base58ToHex`, `hexToBase58`
- [ ] Add documentation about accessing provider methods (point to Near docs, explain relevant methods)
